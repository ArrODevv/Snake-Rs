# Snake
Snake written in [Rust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))

## Note
It is recommended to add this line to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
"rust-analyzer.cargo.buildScripts.enable": false
```

This prevents rust-analyzer from running build scripts, so that the server doesn't bug out when trying to check your workspace.
